# NUT-and-old-serial-APC-ups
My issue(s) setting up a APC ups with nut

I'm letting this here in hope it will help someone (might even be me in the future) on why you cannot get apcupsd nor nut to communicate with your old Serial UPS.
I bought this second hand, and it's working great.

In my case, the UPS is an old APC smart-ups 1000, model SU1000INET.
It features only a serial port and an extension port.
In my case, the expansion port came with a "dry contact cards."mart
